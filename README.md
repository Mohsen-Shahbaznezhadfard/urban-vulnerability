# urban-vulnerability
This model aims to capture urban governance for infrastructure (such as water) at various scales while being exposed to events at local to urban scale.

# Invitation to collaborate
The model project aims to be play an educational role as part of COMSES Net activities. We seek input and suggestions, and when we have sufficient interest we will organize regular virtual events on computational modeling practices, visualization of results, how to use Github as a collaborative platform, etc.
